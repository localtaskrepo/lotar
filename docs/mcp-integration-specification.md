# MCP Integration Specification (Future Development)

*Last Updated: July 30, 2025*
*Status: **FUTURE SPECIFICATION** - Not Currently Implemented*

## ⚠️ Important Notice

This document describes **planned future functionality** for Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration with LoTaR. **None of these features are currently implemented** in the production codebase.

## Current Status

LoTaR v1.0 is production-ready without MCP integration. The system currently provides:
- ✅ Complete CLI interface for task management
- ✅ Web server with REST API
- ✅ Source code scanning for TODOs  
- ✅ Project isolation and search capabilities

## Future MCP Integration Vision

### Planned MCP Server Architecture

The future MCP integration would provide AI agents with efficient task management capabilities:

```rust
// Future implementation concept
pub struct LoTaRMCPServer {
    repository: Arc<RwLock<Storage>>,
    config: MCPServerConfig,
}

pub struct MCPServerConfig {
    pub enabled_tools: HashSet<String>,
    pub max_batch_size: usize,
    pub rate_limit: u32,
}
```

### Planned Tool Categories

#### 1. Task Management Tools
Basic CRUD operations optimized for AI workflows:
- `create_task()` - Create new tasks
- `update_task()` - Modify existing tasks  
- `get_task()` - Retrieve task details
- `list_tasks()` - List with filtering
- `delete_task()` - Remove tasks
- `bulk_operations()` - Batch processing for efficiency

#### 2. Relationship Management
Enhanced task relationships with external system support:
- Internal task dependencies (`depends_on`, `blocks`, `related`)
- External ticket references (`github:org/repo#123`, `jira:PROJ-456`)
- Hierarchical relationships (`parent`, `children`)

#### 3. Context and History Tools
Git-integrated decision tracking:
- Task history with git commit context
- Project context and statistics
- Similar task finding based on content

### Planned External System Integration

Support for external ticket references:
```yaml
# Future YAML format with external links
relationships:
  depends_on: ["AUTH-002"]
  external_links:
    implements: ["github:org/frontend#456", "jira:PROJ-789"]
    depends_on: ["github:#123"]
    references: ["linear:LIN-456"]
```

### Implementation Priority

**Phase 1** (Future):
- Basic MCP server implementation
- Core task management tools
- Simple AI agent interface

**Phase 2** (Future):
- External system integration
- Advanced relationship management
- Git history context tools

**Phase 3** (Future):
- Bulk operations and optimization
- Advanced AI workflow support
- Enterprise integrations

## Current Alternatives

While MCP integration is planned for the future, AI agents can currently interact with LoTaR through:

1. **CLI Interface**: Execute `lotar` commands programmatically
2. **REST API**: HTTP endpoints via the web server (`lotar serve`)
3. **File System**: Direct YAML file manipulation
4. **Git Integration**: Standard git operations on `.tasks/` directory

## Development Timeline

MCP integration is **not scheduled** for implementation in the current development cycle. The core LoTaR system is complete and production-ready without these features.

Future MCP development would require:
- MCP protocol library integration
- Server architecture implementation  
- Tool interface development
- External system connectors
- Comprehensive testing

This specification serves as a design document for potential future development when MCP integration becomes a priority.
