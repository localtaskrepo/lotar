# Bold Implementation Roadmap - Git-Native Requirements Management

*Last Updated: 2025-07-28*
*Revision: Updated for pragmatic task format with standard + custom fields*

## Revolutionary Vision Statement

LoTaR is **git-native requirements management** that creates an immutable audit trail of every decision, requirement change, and project evolution. We're not building another task manager - we're building the first **version-controlled requirements system** where decisions live with code.

## The Bold Implementation Strategy

### Core Principle: Git Commits ARE Decision Points
Every git commit captures a decision - whether from meetings, individual work, code reviews, or any other source. No special workflows needed.

### Primary Interface Focus
- **Web interface**: Primary tool for task management, planning, filtering, reporting
- **IDE plugins**: Code-task linking, contextual task information
- **CLI**: Essential operations, automation, git integration

## Phase 1: Decision Audit Trail Foundation (Week 1-2)
*The killer feature that makes everything else possible*

### 1.1 Pragmatic Task File Format
**Goal**: Standard project management fields + flexible custom fields

```yaml
---
# Built-in standard fields (special handling)
id: "AUTH-001"
title: "Implement OAuth Authentication"
status: "TODO"                     # Built-in enum with extensions
priority: "HIGH"                   # Built-in enum: LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL
type: "feature"                    # Built-in enum: feature, bug, epic, spike, chore
assignee: "john.doe@company.com"   # Autocomplete from git history
project: "webapp"
created: "2025-07-28T10:00:00Z"    # Auto-generated
modified: "2025-07-28T14:30:00Z"   # Auto-updated
due_date: "2025-08-15"             # Date picker in UI
effort: "5d"                       # Special effort field: "5d", "40h", "8sp"

# Built-in structured fields
acceptance_criteria:
  - "User can login with Google OAuth"
  - "User can login with GitHub OAuth"
  
relationships:
  depends_on: ["AUTH-002", "SEC-001"]
  blocks: ["USER-005"]
  related: ["AUTH-003"]

# Custom fields (generic UI treatment based on type)
epic: "user-management"            # String → text search + autocomplete
story_points: 8                    # Number → range filter
security_review_required: true     # Boolean → checkbox filter
affected_components: ["frontend", "backend"]  # Array → multi-select

comments:
  - author: "john.doe"
    date: "2025-07-28T10:00:00Z"
    text: "Starting with Google OAuth first"
---

# Markdown content for rich task description
## Context and Background
[Rich formatted content...]
```

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] Built-in field definitions and validation
- [ ] Custom field type system (string, number, boolean, enum, array)
- [ ] YAML frontmatter parser with schema validation
- [ ] Effort field normalization ("5d" → days, "8sp" → story points)
- [ ] File format versioning and migration

### 1.2 Git Integration Core
**Goal**: Every task change creates meaningful git history

```bash
# Task updates create structured git commits
lotar task update AUTH-001 --status="IN_PROGRESS" --assignee="john.doe"

# Generates git commit:
# "Update AUTH-001: TODO → IN_PROGRESS
# 
# Assigned to john.doe for OAuth implementation
# Due: 2025-08-15 | Effort: 5d | Priority: HIGH"

# Git history becomes the decision trail
git log --oneline .tasks/auth/
f1a2b3c Update AUTH-001: Add GitHub OAuth requirement
e4d5c6b Update AUTH-001: TODO → IN_PROGRESS  
a7b8c9d Create AUTH-001: Implement OAuth Authentication
```

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] Git repository detection and validation
- [ ] Structured commit message generation
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks for task file validation

lotar task update AUTH-001 --status="IN_PROGRESS" --due-date="2025-08-15"
lotar task list --assignee="john.doe" --status="TODO"
lotar task show AUTH-001

# Relationship management
lotar task relate AUTH-001 --depends-on="AUTH-002"
lotar task relate AUTH-001 --blocks="USER-005"

# Comments and custom fields
lotar task comment AUTH-001 "Starting with Google OAuth provider"
