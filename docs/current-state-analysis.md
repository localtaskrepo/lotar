# Current State Analysis

*Last Updated: 2025-01-28*

## What's Currently Implemented ✅

### Core Infrastructure
- **CLI Framework**: Command-line interface with basic routing for `serve`, `task`, `scan`, `config`, `help` commands
- **Modular Architecture**: Well-organized Rust modules (api_server, tasks, store, scanner, project, routes, web_server)
- **Task Data Structure**: Complete Task struct with fields: id, title, subtitle, description, priority, project, category, created, due_date, tags
- **Basic Storage**: Storage struct with file-based persistence logic
- **HTTP Server**: Simple API server with handler registration system

### Task Management
- **Task Creation**: CLI command to create tasks with various properties (title, subtitle, description, priority, etc.)
- **Task Properties**: Support for metadata like tags, categories, due dates, priorities
- **Project Association**: Tasks can be associated with projects

### File Scanner
- **Multi-Language Support**: Comprehensive comment parsing for 15+ programming languages (Rust, Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, etc.)
- **TODO Detection**: Finds TODO comments in source code with case-insensitive matching
- **UUID Management**: Generates UUIDs for TODOs and can parse existing ones from comments
- **Recursive Scanning**: Scans directories recursively for source files

### Web Interface
- **React Frontend**: Modern React app with Material-UI components
- **Routing**: Browser routing with React Router for navigation
- **UI Components**: TasksList, TaskDetails, TaskStatistics with pie chart visualization
- **Responsive Design**: Clean, professional UI with custom theming

## What's Missing or Incomplete ❌

### Core Functionality Gaps
- **Full CRUD Operations**: Only task creation implemented, missing read/update/delete operations
- **Task Listing**: No way to list existing tasks via CLI or API
- **Task Status Management**: No state transitions (TODO → In Progress → Done)
- **Task Search/Filtering**: No search or filtering capabilities

### File System Integration
- **`.tasks` Directory Structure**: The planned folder structure (projects/groups/tasks) not implemented
- **Metadata Files**: metadata.json and index.json files not being created/managed
- **File Persistence**: Tasks not being saved to the planned markdown files

### Configuration System
- **Config Command**: CLI config command exists but has no implementation
- **Environment Variables**: No support for LOTAR_PATH or other env vars
- **Config Files**: No support for package.json or config file detection
- **Default Settings**: No configurable defaults for task properties

### API & Web Integration
- **REST API Endpoints**: Only a test endpoint exists, no actual task management APIs
- **Web-CLI Bridge**: Frontend can't communicate with backend for real data
- **Real-time Updates**: No live data updates between CLI and web interface

### Advanced Features
- **Git Integration**: No git awareness (uncommitted tasks, branch association)
- **IDE Plugins**: No IntelliJ or other IDE plugin development started
- **Hooks/Triggers**: No automation when tasks change state
- **Custom Fields**: No support for user-defined task properties
- **YAML Support**: Code uses JSON despite README preference for YAML

### Scanner Integration
- **Task Creation from TODOs**: Scanner finds TODOs but doesn't create tasks from them
- **File Modification**: Scanner can't update source files with task references
- **TODO-Task Linking**: No connection between found TODOs and managed tasks

## Technical Issues

### Known Problems
- **QuickJS Integration**: README mentions web server compilation issues with QuickJS
- **Missing Dependencies**: Some imports reference non-existent modules
- **Error Handling**: Limited error handling throughout the codebase
- **Testing**: Minimal test coverage (only scanner_test.rs exists)

### Performance Concerns
- **File I/O**: No caching or optimization for repeated file operations
- **Scanning Efficiency**: Scanner may be slow on large codebases
- **Memory Usage**: No memory management for large task datasets

## Usability Assessment

### What Works Now
- Can compile and run the basic CLI
- Can create tasks with rich metadata via command line
- Web interface displays (with mock data)
- File scanner can find TODOs in source code

### What Doesn't Work
- Can't manage existing tasks (list, edit, delete)
- Web interface shows only static data
- No persistence to planned file structure
- Scanner results not integrated with task management
- No configuration options work

## Next Priority Items
1. Implement basic task CRUD operations
2. Create the .tasks directory structure and file persistence
3. Add REST API endpoints for task management
4. Connect web frontend to real backend data
5. Implement task listing and filtering
