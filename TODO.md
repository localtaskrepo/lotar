- inconsistent variable naming with snake and camel case mixed
- Need to validate scaning for TODOs actually works and creates issues
- Add ways to control output verbosity to allow more control as a tool
    Add debug logging for better error tracing
- MCP
- Web
- Index files is generated when there's no content (no mappings)
- We need to add an author to issues ideally read from the current git user, otherwise fallback to environment value or .lotar config
- Add github actions to run tests and link the results in the readme
- we're using default_project instead of default_prefix in the global config.
- Add config validate command that checks that no unknown fields are set, not invalid values, and that no project name is the same as a different prefix (which would break the storage logic. On that note, we should never allow auto creating a prefix that is a project name)
- List/search op only supports project filter right now, should allow sort
- Tasks have relationships, so we should have commands to show them.
- Bug: State changes to same state are allowed. Should at least show a warning.
- Feature: context with references to relevant files for the task. how does this work together with scanning for TODOs?
- Make sure new tasks automatically take the first state from the config as default start state.
- Are all commands supporting the --tasks-dir and evironment variable settings? Do they all resolve parent project dirs?
- When creating a project automatically by adding a new issue, we detect the project name, but we don't store it in config.yml (the project folder has no config.yml)
- The main help does not reflect the actual output and has some useless info

Other refactor jobs:
- Error system
- Log system
- Overall code quality \
    - can functions be combined into utility functions
    - Empty files
    - Unnecessary folders
- Check if the test system can be improved
- We have hard coded issue priority everywhere when it should be read from config file.
    - when no default_priority is set we use the first value.
    - maybe the same issue exists with types and other fields
- Check if there are more tests we need for better coverage and documentation of current features
