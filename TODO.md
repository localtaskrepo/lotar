- inconsistent variable naming with snake and camel case mixed
- Need to validate scaning for TODOs actually works and creates issues
- MCP
- Web
- We need to add an author to issues ideally read from the current git user, otherwise fallback to environment value or .lotar config
- Add github actions to run tests and link the results in the readme
- we're using default_project instead of default_prefix in the global config.
- Add config validate command that checks that no unknown fields are set, not invalid values, and that no project name is the same as a different prefix (which would break the storage logic. On that note, we should never allow auto creating a prefix that is a project name)
- Tasks have relationships, so we should have commands to show them.
- Bug: State changes to same state are allowed. Should at least show a warning.
- Feature: context with references to relevant files for the task. how does this work together with scanning for TODOs?
- Make sure new tasks automatically take the first state from the config as default start state (when there's not default_state defined).
- Are all commands supporting the --tasks-dir and evironment variable settings? Do they all resolve parent project dirs?
- arguments help and --help don't work everywhere (that will be confusing).
- Comments feature (can we allow references to code?)
- project templates need to be reviewed and updated for the latest features
- show global info says we use file type yml, when that's the only type we support
