- Only use `npm test` or `cargo nextest` for running tests. Legacy `cargo test` is forbidden.
- Always run linting and formatting checks before completing a task when there was a code change.
- Always ensure the code builds without warnings before completing a task when there was a code change.
- Always complete a task with running `npm test` and `npm run smoke` when there was a code change.
- Running smoke tests automatically builds the project, so no need to run `npm build` separately.
- Never use git to recover lost code. Use the .history folder instead to access previous versions of files.
- Prefer creating smoke tests instead of manually testing using tmp directories.
